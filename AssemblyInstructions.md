The CAD names of the boards from top to bottom:
- "Hauptplatine"
- "Frontplatte"
- "100 MHz TTL CMOS"
## The finished Frequency Counter
That is the result

## Assembling the different modules
### Boards
The 1st step is to assemble all single boards. That is easy and needs no detailed explaination.
### Preparing the Case
The assembly instructions shows how the boards are installed in the case. As case, I've used
"Bopla UM 52011 L-SET Pult-Geh√§use 223 x 72 x 199 Kunststoff Hellgrau"
with additional back and front plate "Strapubox TWORZYWA SZT.-FP 2 MM C0 Frontplatte" for it.
You start with preparing a drilling template for the front plate. The board on the top is the original one, the board below is the template. From my manufacturer, I've got several boards of the same type, so that I've used one as template. Drill at the marked places larger holes e.g. 5mm for the LEDs and 2mm for the edges of the keys.

Use now the template like shown - the template is in the middle of the front plate - it has two sides, so be careful. The picture shows marking the back side of the front plate. The front side might be a bit sensitive if you are using a waterproof pen.

Transfer all the drills from step before and additionally the three marked ones for 2mm screws to fix the front plate and the board. Use now a pencil and transfer the drills to the frontplate. The holes for the LEDs, you can drill with 5mm. Connect the marked marked edges of the keys.
Four additional holes are required for BNC connectors.
### Labelling of the Front Plate
I've printed page 2 of document "Frontplatte.doc" on transparent inkjet film. Paste the printed film at the front plate. Be careful and avoid air bubbles. The inkjet film is not waterproof, so that I've additionally pasted a transparent film at it - the same one but unprinted. I've used "Herma Transparent lables 210 x 297".
### Assemble Front Plate
You can now assemble the finished front plate and the board "Frontplatte".
Put M2x15 screws into the corresponging drills. Fix with a nut and put 3 plastic washers at it ISO 7089 2,2x5x0,3.

Use the same screws for the board "Frontplatte". Use here 1st one plastic washer and fix it with a nut.

Next step is assembling front plate and its board. Also use here 1st one plastic washer and fix it with a nut.

Now put four plastic washers on each screw of the display and mount the display. Fix the display with one plastic washer and a nut.
