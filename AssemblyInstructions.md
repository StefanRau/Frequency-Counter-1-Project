## Assembling the different modules
### Boards
The 1st step is to assemble all single boards. That is easy and needs no detailed explaination.
### Preparing the Case
The assembly instructions shows how the boards are installed in the case. As case, I've used "Bopla UM 52011 L-SET Pult-Geh√§use 223 x 72 x 199 Kunststoff Hellgrau" from Bopla with additional back and front plate "Strapubox TWORZYWA SZT.-FP 2 MM C0 Frontplatte" for it.
You start with preparing a drilling template for the front plate. The board on the top is the original one, the board below is the template. From my manufacturer, I've got several boards of the same type, so that I've used one as template. Drill at the marked places larger holes e.g. 5mm for the LEDs and 2mm for the edges of the keys.

Use now the template like shown - the template is in the middle of the front plate - it has two sides, so be careful. The picture shows marking the back side of the front plate. The front side might be a bit sensitive if you are using a waterproof pen.

Use now a pencil and transfer the drills to the frontplate. The holes for the LEDs, you can drill with 5mm. Connect the marked marked edges. Transfer all the drills from step before and additionally the three marked ones for 2.5mm screws.
