## Assembling the different modules
### Boards
The 1st step is to assemble all single boards. That is easy and needs no detailed explaination.
### Preparing the Case
The assembly instructions shows how the boards are installed in the case. As case, I've used "Bopla UM 52011 L-SET Pult-Geh√§use 223 x 72 x 199 Kunststoff Hellgrau" from Bopla with additional back and front plate "Strapubox TWORZYWA SZT.-FP 2 MM C0 Frontplatte" for it.
